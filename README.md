# VolticPunk

This is a suite of extensions and utilities built on top of the existing FlashPunk library. It includes an Entity-Component framework, asset management and Ogmo Editor level support.

## Project Structure

The library expects a root folder called assets in src/, with a file A.as in it. This file is generated using scripts, and contains all definitions for asset imports.
